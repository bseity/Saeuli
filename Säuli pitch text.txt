In 2020 alone, 722’000 people in Switzerland were affected by poverty. -Caritas

Solution:
Our solution -> Solidaritätskasse Säuli (swissgerman “Soili” = little piglet)
The aim of the Säuli is not only to provide a little extra relief to those affected, but also as a small feature for conveniance.

Little step – big impact: Even 5 cents make the difference.

Säuli works as a digital collective piggy bank that can be managed by the shop owner (Coop). 
As a customer, you have a possibility to donate or let Säuli cover your small shortage to pay for your groceries.

Säuli is fair: Everyone can take part regardless of socio economic status.

You can be assured that whenever you give your change to Säuli you and society will benefit. 
High security protection will be implemented to ensure safety and fairness.


Säuli makes charity easy. Eliminates Stigma. Provides peace of mind. 


Säuli cares: Säuli reduces workload of staff members, spares time consuming cancelations, returns of products on their shelfs and even food waste. 

Säuli supports even better customer experience if fitted with such lucrative additional functions like pairing with the store benefit point system (Supercard),
integration in Twint and other payment options, adding loyalty benefits and more. 
Result: More value for the customer = ensures loyalty to the store = higher profits.
